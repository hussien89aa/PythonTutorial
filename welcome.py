#This is a simple print statement
print("welcome to python")
#You can use both double quotes("") and single quotes('')
#print("welcome to python'), This is incorrect, double quotes must only be used with double quotes and the same with single quotes
#you can do print('"Do or do not there is no try" -Yoda') You can use double quotes inside of single quotes and vice-versa.
